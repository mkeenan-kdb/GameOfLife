# GameOfLife
Conway's game of life implemented on a html canvas polling data from a q server via websockets

There are many 1 liners in k for this - This version is definitely more than 1 line! I wrote this maybe 2 years ago so improvements are welcome. 

Here it is in action; (screen isn't maximised so as to allow for a larger gif - when the screen is maximised the canvas is centered)
